Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Insert QL code into the left of the application, press parse to make a form. Fill the form and press submit to see the results.

Example input can be found in parser/textQuestionnaires.txt and app/mock-input.ts
